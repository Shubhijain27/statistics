        "The best way to obtain an unbiased sample is to use random sampling. A random sample is a method of sampling in which each member of the population has an equally good chance of being chosen for the sample. Random sampling does not guarantee a representative sample—nothing short of checking the entire population can guarantee that—but it does make it more likely. Random sampling avoids the biases involved with many other methods of sampling.\n",

        "Random sampling falls under the category of probability sampling, which involves selecting samples based on random chance. This approach allows for strong statistical inferences about the whole group, as the sample is representative of the population.\n",

        "In Contrast to Non-Probability Sampling :\n",
        "Non-probability sampling, on the other hand, involves non-random selection based on convenience or other criteria. While this approach may be easier to implement, it can introduce bias and limit the generalizability of findings."
